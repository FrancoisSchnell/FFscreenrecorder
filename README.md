# FFscreenrecorder

A lean screencasting tool for Windows using FFMPEG (Linux soon).

### Dependence on Windows

- FFMPEG (Open Source), static Zeranoe build  http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/
- "Screen Capture DirectShow source filter" (freeware : http://www.umediaserver.net/components) (looking to replace it with an OpenSoruce filter but not requiring Java for the end user)
